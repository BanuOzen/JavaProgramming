  2. You are writing a code for the log-in function of the Cybertek Application,
   assume that your credentials are:
                    username: Cydeo
                    password: Cydeo123

   Ask the user to enter their credentials.
       If credentials are matched, your program should print "Logged in."
       If the credentials are not matched, the program should allow the user to
       have three attempts to enter correct credentials and
       if all three attempts are failed, then print "Your account is locked."
